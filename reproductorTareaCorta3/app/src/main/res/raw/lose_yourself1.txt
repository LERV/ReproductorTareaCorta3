Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity 
to seize everything you ever wanted 
One moment 
would you capture it or just let it slip? 
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
there'ss vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
he's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
to drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin 
what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
he opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
he's chokin, how everybody's jokin now 
the clocks run out, times up over, bloah! 
snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity 
oh, there goes rabbit, he choked 
hes so mad, but he wont give up that 
is he? no 
he wont have it , he knows his whole back citys ropes 
it dont matter, hes dope 
he knows that, but hes broke 
hes so stacked that he knows 
when he goes back to his mobile home, thats when its 
back to the lab again yo 
this whole rap shit 
he better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him 
Hook: 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
you own it, you better never let it go 
you only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo 
The souls escaping, through this hole that its gaping 
this world is mine for the taking 
make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
a normal life is borin, but superstardoms close to post mortar 
it only grows harder, only grows hotter 
he blows us all over these hoes is all on him 
coast to coast shows, hes know as the globetrotter 
lonely roads, god only knows 
hes grown farther from home, hes no father 
he goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
but hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water 
His bosses dont want him no mo, hes cold product 
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows 
he nose dove and sold nada 
so the soap opera is told and unfolds 
i suppose its old potna, but the beat goes on 
da da dum da dum da da 
Hook 
No more games, ima change what you call rage 
tear this mothafuc*** roof off like 2 dogs caged 
i was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed 
i been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
but i kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher 
best believe somebodys payin the pied piper 
all the pain inside amplified by the fact 
that i cant get by with my 9 to 5 
and i cant provide the right type of life for my family 
cuz man, these goddam food stamps dont buy diapers 
and its no movie, theres no mekhi phifer, this is my life 
and these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
tryin to feed and water my seed, plus 
see dishonor caught up bein a father and a prima donna 
baby mama drama screamin on and 
too much for me to wanna 
stay in one spot, another jam or not 
has gotten me to the point, i'm like a snail 
i've got to formulate a plot fore i end up in jail or shot 
success is my only mothafuc*** option, failures not 
mom, i love you, but this trail has got to go 
i cannot grow old in salems lot 
so here i go is my shot. 
feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that i got
